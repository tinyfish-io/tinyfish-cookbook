## About This Repository

Welcome to the **TinyFish Cookbook!** A growing collection of recipes, demos, and automations built on TinyFish — the web layer for AI agents.

If your agent needs to search the live web, read a page cleanly, run a multi-step browser flow, or hit any site that doesn't expose an API, this is where to start.

## The Endpoints

TinyFish gives you four endpoints, layered from lightning-fast retrieval to fully managed browser automation. **Search** and **Fetch** are free.

| Endpoint | What it does | Best for | Speed | Pricing |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------|---------|
| **Search** &nbsp; `api.search.tinyfish.ai` | Fast, structured web search built for agents — JSON results, rank-stable across calls. | Drop-in retrieval layer for any agent. Designed for LLM consumption, not blue-link browsing. | < 0.5s | **Free** |
| **Fetch** &nbsp; `api.fetch.tinyfish.ai` | Any URL &rarr; clean markdown / JSON / HTML. Real full-browser rendering. Failed URLs are free. | Reading specific pages and feeding clean content to LLMs. Drop-in replacement for Firecrawl, native LLM fetch, or hand-rolled Playwright. | A few seconds | **Free** |
| **Agent** | Provide a URL and a natural-language goal. The agent navigates, acts, and returns clean JSON. | Multi-step flows, complex tasks, structured data extraction. | ~10s to minutes | Metered |
| **Browser** | Rent a fully managed cloud browser. Connect your own Playwright or Selenium scripts. | Hardcore custom agents and scripts. | Real-time | Metered |

## Why TinyFish?

- **Any website &rarr; API** — turn sites without APIs into programmable data sources
- **Natural-language goals** — send a URL + plain English, get structured JSON back
- **Real browser automation** — multi-step flows, forms, filters, calendars, dynamic content
- **Built-in stealth** — rotating proxies and stealth profiles included, no extra cost
- **Vault** — agent-grade credentials and session memory for authenticated workflows (1Password JIT, encrypted session reuse)
- **Production-grade observability** — full logs and debugging on every run
- **Token-efficient by design** — Fetch strips nav, scripts, and cookie banners, so you stop paying tokens on junk HTML

## Ways to use TinyFish

One API key. Use it from wherever you build.

### REST API

```bash
# Search
curl "https://api.search.tinyfish.ai?query=web+automation+tools" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $TINYFISH_API_KEY"

# Fetch
curl -X POST https://api.fetch.tinyfish.ai \
  -H "X-API-Key: $TINYFISH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"urls": ["https://www.tinyfish.ai/"]}'

# Agent (streaming)
curl -N -X POST https://agent.tinyfish.ai/v1/automation/run-sse \
  -H "X-API-Key: $TINYFISH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://agentql.com", "goal": "Find all subscription plans and prices. Return JSON."}'
```

### MCP Server

Drop the server URL into Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, ChatGPT desktop, or any MCP-aware client.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tinyfish": { "url": "https://mcp.tinyfish.ai" }
  }
}
```

### CLI

```bash
npm install -g @tiny-fish/cli
tinyfish auth login
tinyfish search query "web automation tools"
tinyfish fetch content get https://example.com
```

The CLI writes results to the filesystem instead of piping them through your model's context window — tokens stay low, output stays structured.

### Scripts

Drop TinyFish into everyday tools with small copyable scripts.

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Raycast TinyFish Search](./scripts/raycast-tinyfish-search) | Search the web from Raycast and get formatted result URLs, titles, and snippets |

### Agent Skill

One-line install. Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Antigravity, and other coding agents. The Skill teaches your agent **when** to reach for Search vs. Fetch vs. Agent, and **how** to call them.

```bash
npx skills add github.com/tinyfish-io/tinyfish-cookbook --skill use-tinyfish
```

Browse it on [skills.sh/tinyfish-io/tinyfish-cookbook/use-tinyfish](https://skills.sh/tinyfish-io/tinyfish-cookbook/use-tinyfish).

### SDKs

```bash
pip install tinyfish              # Python
npm install @tiny-fish/sdk        # TypeScript
```

Both SDKs cover Search, Fetch, Browser, Agent, and Vault — full parity.
