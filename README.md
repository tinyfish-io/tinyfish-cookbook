# TinyFish Cookbook 🐟🍳

Welcome to the **TinyFish Cookbook** — a growing collection of mini-projects, demos, and real-world use cases built with the [TinyFish](https://tinyfish.io) web agent.

Think of this as a recipe book, except instead of food, it's full of cool automations that people from all over the world have cooked up. Browse around, get inspired, steal ideas (legally), and build something awesome.

## What is TinyFish?

TinyFish is an AI-powered web agent. Point it at a website, tell it what to do, and watch it browse, click, fill forms, extract data, and get things done — all through a simple API.

## What's in the Cookbook?

Each folder at the root of this repo is a standalone project. Dive into any one of them to see what people have built:

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| *Your project here!* | *Be the first to contribute* 🚀 |

> As projects get added, this table will grow. Check back often!

## Getting Started

Want to try one out? Each project has its own README with setup instructions. Just:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tinyfish-io/TinyFish-cookbook.git
cd TinyFish-cookbook/<project-name>
# Follow the project's README from there!
```

## Contributing
