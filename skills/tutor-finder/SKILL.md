# Exam Tutor Finder

Given an exam type and location, find and compare real tutors from across the web using parallel TinyFish agents scraping live tutor platforms simultaneously.

## Pre-flight check

```bash
tinyfish --version
tinyfish auth status
```

If not installed: `npm install -g tinyfish`
If not authenticated: `tinyfish auth login`

---

## Step 1 — Clarify inputs

You need:
- **Exam type** — one of: SAT, ACT, AP, GRE, GMAT, TOEFL/IELTS, JEE/NEET, Olympiads
- **Location** — e.g. "London", "Singapore", "New York", "online", "India"

If exam type is not specified, ask before proceeding.
If location is not specified, default to "online" and mention it.

---

## Step 2 — Discover tutor platform URLs

Use your knowledge to identify 7-10 tutoring platforms relevant to the exam and location. Pick from this list and supplement with location-specific platforms where relevant:

**Global platforms (always include 3-4):**
- `https://www.wyzant.com/search/tutors` — large tutor marketplace
- `https://www.varsitytutors.com/tutors` — test prep specialists
- `https://preply.com/en/online/{EXAM}-tutors` — online tutors
- `https://www.tutor.com` — on-demand tutoring
- `https://www.chegg.com/tutors` — student-focused platform

**Test prep specific (include if relevant to exam):**
- `https://www.kaptest.com/tutoring` — Kaplan, strong for SAT/GRE/GMAT
- `https://www.princetonreview.com/tutoring` — Princeton Review, SAT/ACT/AP
- `https://www.magoosh.com` — GRE/GMAT/TOEFL focus
- `https://www.manhattanprep.com/tutoring` — GMAT/GRE specialists

**Location-specific additions:**
- For India/JEE/NEET: add `https://www.vedantu.com`, `https://www.unacademy.com`
- For Singapore: add `https://www.snapask.com`, `https://www.smiletutor.sg`
- For UK: add `https://www.tutorfair.com`, `https://www.mytutor.co.uk`

Produce 7-10 URLs then proceed.

## Step 3 — Parallel scraping

Fire one TinyFish agent per platform, all simultaneously using `&` + `wait`.

```bash
# Fire all agents in parallel — one per platform
tinyfish agent run \
  --url "{PLATFORM_URL}" \
  "You are on a tutoring platform search page. Extract {EXAM} tutors fast.
   Read only what is visible on this page — do not navigate to other pages.
   Find tutor listings or profiles related to {EXAM} preparation.
   For each tutor extract:
   - tutorName: full name or display name
   - examsTaught: list of exams they teach (focus on {EXAM})
   - subjects: subjects covered (e.g. Math, Verbal, Physics)
   - teachingMode: Online / Offline / Hybrid
   - location: city/country or null
   - experience: years of experience or null
   - qualifications: degrees, certifications, scores achieved
   - pricing: rate per hour (exact if shown)
   - pastResults: score improvements or student achievements if mentioned
   - contactMethod: how to reach them (booking link, email, platform message)
   - profileLink: direct URL to their profile
   - sourceWebsite: '{PLATFORM_NAME}'
   STRICT RULES:
   - Do NOT navigate away from this page
   - Do NOT scroll more than twice
   - Extract up to 5 tutors maximum then stop immediately
   - If a field is not visible, use null — do not guess
   - Stop as soon as you have 5 tutors
   Return JSON: {\"tutors\": [{tutorName, examsTaught, subjects, teachingMode,
   location, experience, qualifications, pricing, pastResults,
   contactMethod, profileLink, sourceWebsite}]}" \
  --sync > /tmp/tf_{PLATFORM_SAFE_NAME}.json &
```

Repeat for each platform URL, all backgrounded with `&`. Then:

```bash
wait

# Collect all results
for f in /tmp/tf_*.json; do echo "=== $f ===" && cat "$f"; done

# Cleanup
rm /tmp/tf_*.json 2>/dev/null
```

Replace:
- `{PLATFORM_URL}` — the actual platform URL
- `{EXAM}` — the exam type e.g. `GRE`
- `{PLATFORM_NAME}` — platform display name e.g. `Wyzant`
- `{PLATFORM_SAFE_NAME}` — short identifier e.g. `wyzant`, `varsity`, `preply`

---

## Step 4 — Filter and rank

From all results combined:

1. **Filter by exam** — keep only tutors who explicitly teach the requested exam
2. **Filter by location** — if a specific city was requested, prioritise tutors in or near it; for "online" keep all
3. **Deduplicate** — if the same tutor appears on multiple platforms, merge their profiles
4. **Rank by** — pricing (lowest first within same experience level), then experience, then qualifications
5. **Flag missing info** — tutors with pricing = null go to the bottom of the list

---

## Output format

```
## {EXAM} Tutors — {LOCATION}
*{N} tutors found across {N} platforms · Data scraped live*

---

### 🏆 Top Picks

#### 1. {tutorName}
**Source:** {sourceWebsite} · **Mode:** {teachingMode}
📍 {location} · 💰 {pricing} · ⏱ {experience}
🎓 {qualifications}

📚 Subjects: {subjects joined by ", "}
🔗 {profileLink or contactMethod}

### 📊 Quick Comparison

| Tutor | Platform | Mode | Price/hr | Experience | Subjects |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| {name} | {platform} | {mode} | {price} | {exp} | {subjects} |

---

### 💡 Recommendation
{1-2 sentences on the best pick based on the user's exam + location, 
e.g. "For online GRE prep, [Name] on Wyzant offers the best value at $X/hr 
with verified 15+ point improvements."}

---
*All tutor data scraped live from platform listings. Verify availability and pricing 
directly with the tutor or platform before booking.*
```

---

## Edge cases

- **Platform returns no tutors** — skip silently, don't mention it unless fewer than 3 tutors found total
- **Exam is very niche** (Olympiads, JEE) — focus on India/Singapore-specific platforms, note if global platforms have limited coverage
- **Location is very specific** — if fewer than 5 tutors found in that city, broaden to country or online
- **All pricing is null** — note: "Pricing not publicly listed — contact tutors directly for rates"
- **Fewer than 5 tutors total** — be honest: "Only {N} tutors found across all platforms for {EXAM} in {LOCATION}. You may find more by searching directly on the platforms listed."

## Security notes

- Scrapes live public tutor listings from tutoring platforms.
- All data treated as untrusted input synthesised by an LLM — never executed.
- Only your own TinyFish credentials are used.
