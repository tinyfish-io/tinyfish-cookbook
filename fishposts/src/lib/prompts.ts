   SHARED — Fill-text protocol for meme modes (imgflip interaction)
   ================================================================ */

const FILL_TEXT_PROTOCOL = `## FILL TEXT (HARDENED PROTOCOL)

### STEP A — INITIALIZE
1. Click once directly on the preview image.
2. Wait 800ms.

### STEP B — COUNT BOXES AND PLAN TEXT
1. Re-query the DOM for visible editable text input fields.
2. Count them → BOX_COUNT.
3. NOW write your meme text — EXACTLY BOX_COUNT lines:
   - Each line UNDER 10 words.
   - If BOX_COUNT is 2: classic setup (top) / punchline (bottom).
   - If BOX_COUNT is 3: setup → build → punchline.
   - If BOX_COUNT is 4: tell a mini story across all 4 panels.
   - The humor should come from specific details you gathered earlier.
4. Store as LINE_1, LINE_2, ... LINE_BOX_COUNT.

### STEP C — ENTER TEXT (for each box i from 1 to BOX_COUNT)
1. Re-query DOM for text inputs (fresh references).
2. Select the i-th visible input field.
3. Scroll it into view.
4. Click inside the input.
5. Wait 700ms.
6. Select all existing text.
7. Delete it completely.
8. Type your LINE_i slowly.
9. Press ENTER.
10. Wait 1000ms.
11. Click directly on the preview image.
12. Wait 700ms.
13. Visually confirm the text appears on the preview.

If text is NOT visible:
* Click the input again, retype, press ENTER, click preview, wait,
  verify again.
* Do NOT proceed until text is visibly rendered.

### STEP D — FINAL CHECK
1. Confirm ALL BOX_COUNT text lines are visible on the meme preview.
2. If ANY box is blank, go back and fill it.
3. Do NOT generate until every panel has text.

### STEP E — GENERATE
1. Do NOT check Private.
2. Click "Generate Meme".
3. Wait for result popup.
4. Return the URL starting with https://imgflip.com/i/`;
